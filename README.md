# I unfortunately don't have the time anymore to play and update my mods. If anyone wants to update/change the mod. Feel free to do that. :)


# Description
 

I hate how the Vanilla Nutrient Paste Dispenser isn't 100% flush with the Wall. So i made a Over-Wall Nutrient Paste Dispenser inspired by the Over-Wall Cooler from [Replace Stuff](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1372003680).

**If you're using the Dispenser in a Prison and your Prisoners aren't using it, place a Door under the Dispenser like shown here: https://imgur.com/VA8HAQ1
It is how the Game is designed and i can't do much about it. This is the easiest and cheapest Solution i could find. I'm Sorry. :(**

# Compatibility
 

A Patch for [NPD Tiers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2043895447) is included.
